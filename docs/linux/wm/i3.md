# i3

Design principles of i3:

* Minimalism - "Just a" window manager, no integration with applications
* Tiling - Efficient non-overlapping positioning of application windows
* Keyboard Workflow - Complete functionality mapped to (customizable) shortcuts
* Integration - Easy integration with launchers (i.e. Rofi) status bars (i.e. Polybar)
