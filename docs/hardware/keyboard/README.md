# Mechanical Keyboards

Mechanical keyboards use a mechanical mechanism (key switch) 
to record a key stroke:

Most keyboards are not mechanical, broadly two categories:

* **Capacitive** (most common type of keyboard)
  - Designed to be cheap an easy to produce
  - Light "squishy",  quiet typing experience
  - Rubber domes over a membrane contact sheet
  - Do not physically complete a circuit
  - Change in current flow on the key matrix detected by the processor
  - Rated at 1-10 million key strokes
* **Mechanical**
  - Designed for quality and durability
  - More comfortable and enjoyable typing experience
  - Better precision in gaming
  - Different level of audible and tactile response
  - More durable 20-100 million key strokes

### Qualities

The "feel" of a keyboard varies depending on the following qualities:

* Switch types (force, feedback)
* Switch mount construction
* Case construction (sturdiness, angel, tilt)
* Keycap construction (shape, size)
* Keycap print (readability)

### Sizes

List of keyboard sizes [05]:

* **Full-size**, 100%, 104/105 keys
  - Alphanumeric keys
  - Arrow keys (navigation cluster)
  - Function keys (F-row)
  - Number pad
* **96-key**
  - All 100% keyboard keys
  - More compact form factor
  - No space between the different key clusters
* **Tenkeyless** (TKL)
  - 80% off a full size keyboard
  - Does not have a number pad
* **75%**, ~84 keys
  - No number pad
  - Arrow keys
  - Function keys
  - Some control keys
  - More compact form factor then TKL
* **65%**, ~65 keys
  - No number pad
  - No function keys
  - Arrow keys
  - Some control keys (PgUp, PgDn, Ins, Del)
* **60%**, ~61 keys
  - No number pad
  - No function keys
  - No arrow keys

Typically missing keys are available on a  different layer 
accessed by an `Fn` function key.

## Layouts

Different **mechanical layouts** [07], [08]:

* **ISO**
  - Enter/return key: horizontal **L shape**
  - Smaller shift keys
* **ANSI**
  - Predominantly in the United States
  - Enter/return key: vertical **wide rectangle**
* Others: JIS (Japan), KS, ABNT

The **home row keys** are the row on the keyboard the fingers rest on when not
typing. On Latin-script keyboard layouts following configuration exists:

Name     | Home row keys
---------|--------------
QUERTY   | asdf jkl;
Dvorak   | aoeu htns
Colemark | arst neio

* Thumb rests on the spacebar
* This finger position typically increases typing speed amd accuracy




## Switches

On mechanical keyboards the switch determines how typing feels.

### Switch Types

Mechanical switches, divided into three categories:

* Linear (i.e. Cherry MX Red)
  - Recommended for a quieter environment
  - Consistent (straight-down), smooth key press
  - No tactile feedback (bump)
  - No audible click noise
  - More rapid actuation
  - Resistance increases in a linear fashion along the travel of the key
* Tactile (i.e. Cherry MX Brown)
  - More ergonomic and fluid typing experience
  - Tactile feedback, noticeable bump in the middle of travel
  - Bump is located at the point of actuation, where a key press is registered
  - Indication of a press without needing to bottom out your keys
* Clicky (i.e. Cherry MX Blue)
  - Like a tactile switch
  - Distinct “click” sound when the key is activated

### Characteristics

* Operation Force (measured in centinewton (cN) or gram-force (gf))
  - Light 0-55 cN
  - Medium 55-75 cN
  - Heavy 75-95 cN
  - Super Heavy 95+ cN
* Actuation Point (measured in millimeters)
  - Point where a keypress is recognized by the keyboard
  - Typically 1.1 - 2.5 mm
* Travel Distance (measured in millimeters)
  - Distance until the key press reaches the bottom
  - Typically 3.5 - 4 mm
* Reset Point - Distance at which the key is deactivated when released
* Durability (measured in number of key presses)
  - 50 - 80 million for metal contact
  - >100 million for optical
* Hot-swappable vs. soldered switches

# Glossary

* Bottoming out - When the switches are depressed all the way down.
* Key Matrix - Circuitry setup within the keyboard. A grid 
  through which the processor identifies the location of a 
  keystroke.
  - Character Map - Lookup table to match with the key matrix
    on a key press. Represents a character for each keystroke
    or combination of keystrokes.
  - The character map in stored in the keyboard ROM. Typically
    configured by an application/operating system.
* Key Bounce - Mechanical vibration cased by pressing the key,
  filtered by de-bounce circuit or in software.
* Keycap - Plastic top cap with the letter printing 
* O-Rings - Dampen the sound your keycaps make when you bottom out
* Stem - Mount for the keycap (part of the switch)
* Switch puller - Small tool to remove keycaps
