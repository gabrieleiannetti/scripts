# Mechanical Keyboards

### Size

List of keyboard sizes [05]:

* **Full-size**, 100%
  - Alphanumeric keys
  - Arrow keys (navigation cluster)
  - Function keys (F-row)
  - Number pad
* **96-key**
  - All 100% keyboard keys
  - More compact form factor
  - No space between the different key clusters
* **Tenkeyless** (TKL)
  - 80% off a full size keyboard
  - Does not have a number pad
* **75%**, ~84 keys
  - No number pad
  - Arrow keys
  - Function keys
  - Some control keys
  - More compact form factor then TKL
* **65%**, ~65 keys
  - No number pad
  - No function keys
  - Arrow keys
  - Some control keys (PgUp, PgDn, Ins, Del)
* **60%**, ~61 keys
  - No number pad
  - No function keys
  - No arrow keys

Typically missing keys are available on a  different layer 
accessed by an `Fn` function key.

## Switches

### Technologies

* Capacitive
  - Do not physically complete a circuit
  - Change in current flow on the key matrix detected by the processor
* Mechanical
  - Different level of audible and tactile response
  - More durable than rubber dome keyboards

### Categories

Mechanical switches, divided into three categories:

* Linear (i.e. Cherry MX Brown)
  - Keystroke consistent and smooth (no tactile 'bump')
  - No tactile feedback
  - No click noise
  - More rapid actuation
  - Tesistance increases in a linear fashion along the travel of the key
* Tactile (i.e. Cherry MX Blue)
  - Tactile feedback, noticeable bump in the middle of travel
  - Indication of a keypress without needing to bottom out your keys
* Clicky
  - Like a tactile switch
  - Distinct “click” sound when the key is activated

### Characteristics

* Operation Force (measured in centinewton (cN) or gram-force (gf))
  - Light 0-55 cN
  - Medium 55-75 cN
  - Heavy 75-95 cN
  - Super Heavy 95+ cN
* Actuation Point (measured in millimeters)
  - Point where a keypress is recognized by the keyboard
  - Typically 1.1 - 2.5 mm
* Travel Distance (measured in millimeters)
  - Distance until the key press reaches the bottom
  - Typically 3.5 - 4 mm
* Reset Point - Distance at which the key is deactivated when released
* Durability (measured in number of key presses)
  - 50 - 80 million for metal contact
  - >100 million for optical
* Hot-swappable vs. soldered switches

# Glossary

* Key Matrix - Circuitry setup within the keyboard. A grid 
  through which the processor identifies the location of a 
  keystroke.
  - Character Map - Lookup table to match with the key matrix
    on a key press. Represents a character for each keystroke
    or combination of keystrokes.
  - The character map in stored in the keyboard ROM. Typically
    configured by an application/operating system.
* Key Bounce - Mechanical vibration cased by pressing the key,
  filtered by de-bounce circuit or in software.
* Bottoming Out - When the switches are depressed all the way down.
* Keycap - Plastic top cap with the letter printing 
* Stem - Mount for the keycap (part of the switch)
* Switch puller - Small tool to remove keycaps
* O-Rings - Dampen the sound your keycaps make when you bottom out
