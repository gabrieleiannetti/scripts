Key Matrix - Circuitry setup within the keyboard. A grid 
through which the processor identifies the location of a 
keystroke.

* Character Map - Lookup table to match with the key matrix
  on a key press. Represents a character for each keystroke
  or combination of keystrokes.
* The character map in stored in the keyboard ROM. Typically
  configured by an application/operating system.



## Switch

Terminology

* bounce - Mechanical vibration cased by pressing the key,
  filtered by de-bounce circuit or in software.
* Keycap - Plastic top cap with the letter printing 
* Stem - Mount for the keycap (part of the switch)
* Switch puller - Small tool to remove keycaps
* O-Rings - Dampen the sound your keycaps make when you bottom out

### Technologies

* Capacitive
  - Do not physically complete a circuit
  - Change in current flow on the key matrix detected by the processor
* Mechanical
  - Different level of audible and tactile response
  - More durable than rubber dome keyboards

### Categories

Mechanical switches, divided into three categories:

* Linear (i.e. Cherry MX Brown)
  - Keystroke consistent and smooth
  - No tactile feedback
  - No click noise
  - More rapid actuation
* Tactile (i.e. Cherry MX Blue)
  - Tactile feedback, noticeable bump in the middle of travel
  - Indication of a keypress without needing to bottom out your keys
* Clicky
  - Like a tactile switch
  - Distinct “click” sound when the key is activated

### Characteristics

* Operation Force (measured in centinewton (cN) or gram-force (gf))
  - Light 0-55 cN
  - Medium 55-75 cN
  - Heavy 75-95 cN
  - Super Heavy 95+ cN
* Actuation Point (measured in millimeters)
  - Point where a keypress is recognized by the keyboard
  - Typically 1.1 - 2.5 mm
* Travel Distance (measured in millimeters)
  - Distance until the key press reaches the bottom
  - Typically 3.5 - 4 mm
* Reset Point - Distance at which the key is deactivated when released
* Durability (measured in number of key presses)
  - 50 - 80 million for metal contact
  - >100 million for optical
* Hot-swappable vs. soldered switches
