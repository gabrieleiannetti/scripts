# Text

Commands used to work with text (strings): 

```bash
grep                    # print lines matching a pattern
sort                    # sort lines of a text file
uniq                    # report or omit repeated lines
cut                     # remove sections from each line of files
tr                      # translate or delete characters
sed                     # stream editor for filtering and transforming text
awk                     # pattern scanning and processing language
fmt                     # text formater
paste                   # merge lines of files
split                   # split files into pieces
tac                     # concatenate and print files in reverse
```

## Encoding

[Code][co], system of rules to **convert information** (letters, words, sound, images) 
into another form or representation for data transmissions/storage:

* **Decoding** is the reverse process, converting code symbols back
* [Character encodings][cc] are representations of textual data
* Character encoding associated with a specific character set (collection or representable characters)

[co]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code
[cc]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding

```bash
locale                   # current language and encoding settings           
localectl                # ^^with systemd tools
file -bi <file>          # show file encoding
# change encoding from ASCII to UTF-8
iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii -o <out_file> <in_file>
# change encoding from UTF-8 charset to ASCII, omit invalid characters
iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii -o <out_file> <in_file>
```

### Standards

[ASCII][ai], single byte encoding only using the bottom **7 bits**

* ASCII order (ASCIIbetical)
  - Uppercase come before lowercase letters
  - Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters
* First 32 codes (0â€“31 decimal) for **control characters**
* Many 8-bit encodings which are supersets of ASCII

[UTF-8][u8], general-purpose way of representing [Unicode][un] characters

* Character encoded as sequence of 1-4 bytes (variable width character encoding)
* Designed for backward **compatibility with ASCII** (valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode)
* Unicode [code charts][uc]

## Characters

Conventions to describe characters

* **Octal** digit characters (01234567), `\<octal>` 1,2 or 3 
* **Escape sequence**, starting with a backslash  `\[abfnrtv]`
* **Caret notation**, `^` followed by a single character (usually a capital letter) 

```bash
printf `\O`                         # print octal
printf '\xH'                        # print hex H
printf "\\$(printf %o D)"           # print decimal d
```

### Non-Printable Characters

Non-pritnable (white-space) characters:

* **space** (blank, word divider)
* backspace (BS), `\b`, `^H`
* **tab** (horizontal tab (HT), `\t`, `\011`, `^I`
* **newline** (line feed (LF)), `\n`, `\012`, `^J`
* null (NUL) `\0`, `^@`
* escape (ESC) `\e`, `^[`

`cat` show non-printable characters with `-A` (equivalent to `-vET`)

```bash
>>> s="\tone\n\011two\040three\0"
>>> echo "$s" | cat -A
^Ione$
^Itwo three^@$
```

^ and M- notation (100-137 ascii chars), for LF `$`

`od` show non-printable chars with backslash escapes:

```bash
>>> echo "$s" | od -c
0000000  \t   o   n   e  \n  \t   t   w   o       t   h   r   e   e  \0
0000020  \n
0000021
```
