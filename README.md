Description
===========

This repository contains lots of scripts for various purposes
developed to make my life easier. I do maintain a personal 
library of such scripts since years. Some of them may be of
use for others, therefore I plan to add more scripts to this
repository from time to time.

  default editor lots of aliases and a global gitignore file.
