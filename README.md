Description
===========

This repository contains lots of scripts for various purposes
developed to make my life easier. I do maintain a personal 
library of such scripts since years. Some of them may be of
use for others, therefore I plan to add more scripts to this
repository from time to time. 

Scripts
-------

* **git-default-config** - sets Git user name, mail address, 
  default editor lots of aliases and a global gitignore file.
* **git-repos** - maintains a directory structure and corresponding 
  Git remote repositories.
* **music** - Controls the local Music Player Daemon.
* **ruby-skeleton** - Start developing ruby scripts from here.
* **ssh-known-hosts** - Remove/add/update SSH host fingerprints.
* **tmux-cheat** - Most important Tmux keys.
* **tmux-default-config** - helps to configure Tmux terminal
  multiplexer.

  a couple of Bundles, and my personal Vim configuration.
* **zsh-default-config** - helps to install Oh-My-Zsh and my
  default Zsh configuration.
