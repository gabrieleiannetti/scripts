Description
===========

This repository contains lots of scripts for various purposes
developed to make my life easier. I do maintain a personal 
library of such scripts since years. Some of them may be of
use for others, therefore I plan to add more scripts to this
repository from time to time. 

Scripts
-------

* _git-default-config_ helps users to configure Git. Sets
  user name, mail address, default editor lots of aliases
  and a global gitignore file.
* _tmux-default-config_ helps to configure Tmux terminal
  muliplexer.
* _vim-default-config_ helps to install Vundle including
  a couple of Bundles, and my personal Vim configuration.
* _vim-cheat_ "What was this key again?" Vim cheat sheat.
